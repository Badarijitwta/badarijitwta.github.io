                <p>This column comes with a warning: Do not try to solve this math problem.
                    The infamous Collatz conjecture says that if you start with any positive integer,
                    you’ll always end up in this loop. And you’ll probably ignore my warning about 
                    trying to solve it: It just seems too simple and too orderly to resist
                    understanding. In fact, it would be hard to find a mathematician who hasn’t 
                    played around with this problem.

                    <p>Lothar Collatz (German: [ˈkɔlaʦ]; July 6, 1910 – September 26, 1990) was a German mathematician, born in Arnsberg, Westphalia.

                    The 3x + 1 problem is also known as the Collatz conjecture, named after him and still unsolved. The Collatz–Wielandt formula for the Perron–Frobenius eigenvalue of a positive square matrix was also named after him.
                    
                    Collatz's 1957 paper with Ulrich Sinogowitz,[1] who had been killed in the bombing of Darmstadt in World War II,[2] founded the field of spectral graph theory.</p>
